# Example file (not rendered)

That's where we are since so long...

## These are headers, same as Markdown but you can make as much as you want

### Like this

######## Or this (but you need a .css file to handle more than 6 header sizes)

-# It alos handle Discord-like subtexts

!var foo:bar /' it Also handle variables, they are invisible when defined and can be used all across the docuent, must be defined before use, are treated as text

/'' These are comments by the way
Multiline comments to be precise
one ' for one-line comment, two ' ('') for a multiline comment
and close it with ''/

This is a basic text, and with the following syntax "!{foo}" you can get back the variable created earlier

Note: you can disable getting variable by adding a "\\" before calling it.

Bu they can also contain separate whitelines like :

|Column 1||Column 2|
|-||-|
